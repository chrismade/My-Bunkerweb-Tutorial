## (rootless) bunkerweb on coreos

Bunkerweb is no bootable solution - it needs a host OS to run - and while there are many options to install and run bunkerweb in different environments I want to show here [one concrete option in detail based on Fedora CoreOS](/coreos/README.md)- with comprehensive examples and explanation

In brief CoreOS is a bootable OS optimzed to run containerize workloads - which has built-in updating and A/B boot capabilities and is largely write protected to ensure integrity - and which contains everything which is a required to run a feature rich bunkerweb installation - as shown in these notes.
